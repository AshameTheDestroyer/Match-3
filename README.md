# Match-3
A challenge for me to build a simple match-3 board-game.

This game is about having a board of n√ón cells, filled with m random icons.
You'll have to play a specific moves to make a 3 or more icons match, whether it was horizontally, vertically, or both at the same time.
And you're allowed to move two icons at a time, swapping them horizontally or vertically.
Each time you match 3 or more icons, their cells change colour into more lit one, indicating that these cells have been played and won.

It's not complete yet, but the game's supposed to end when you lit each cell within the board, but since there's nothing like a timer, or a cell destroyer, you pretty much cannot lose.

Glad I uploaded this game at the first day of the new year, even though this version was supposed to be released since like two months, LOL.

Enjoy...
